                        <p>Julia is a multidisciplinary creative
                            and entrepreneur working at the intersection
                            of visual design, branding, and emotional storytelling.
                            She creates cohesive visual worlds through
                            illustration, surface pattern design, and 
                            thoughtfully built brand identities, often
                            blending softness, nostalgia, and depth
                            with strategic clarity. </p>
                        <p>With a strong understanding of both aesthetics
                            and business, Julia develops digital products,
                            brand systems, and content designed to
                            resonate emotionally while remaining
                            commercially viable. Her work is informed
                            by curiosity, self-directed learning, and
                            a highly intuitive yet analytic approach 
                            to problem solving. </p>
                        <p> Julia is currently expanding her practice
                            across digital design, product development,
                            and web-development, while building 
                            multiple creative brands and platforms
                        </p>
