                <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>Julia is a multidisciplinary creative
                        and entrepreneur working at the intersection
                        of visual design, branding, and emotional storytelling.
                        She creates cohesive visual worlds through
                        illustration, surface pattern design, and 
                        thoughtfully built brand identities, often
                        blending softness, nostalgia, and depth
                        with strategic clarity. </p>
                    <p>With a strong understanding of both aesthetics
                        and business, Julia develops digital products,
                        brand systems, and content designed to
                        resonate emotionally while remaining
                        commercially viable. Her work is informed
                        by curiosity, self-directed learning, and
                        a highly intuitive yet analytic approach 
                        to problem solving. </p>
                    <p> Julia is currently expanding her practice
                        across digital design, product development,
                        and web-development, while building 
                        multiple creative brands and platforms
                    </p>    
            </main>
